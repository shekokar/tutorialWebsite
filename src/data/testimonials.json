Concepts clearing, doubt solving, support given during the exams till late nights was commendable.\nNo matter how many times student asks his doubt that many times his doubts are cleared. Most important no teacher looks down on any student or humilate any one. All kids are same for these teachers. This being the main reason why even students look forward for going to classes."
